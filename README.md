# Introduction

Multi Tenant example using database per tenant (MultiDB)

>**NOTE:** The example uses two DB Contexts to prevent a circular reference with the `Http Resolver`. Possible fix to not use multiple contexts is to implement the repository pattern that will abstract the context usage.

# Docker compose for SQLServer

For this example SQL server was ran in docker using the `docker-compose` file located in the root of this project. For reference see the contents of the compose file below.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  mssql:
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
    ports:
      - 1433:1433
    environment:
      - ACCEPT_EULA="Y"
      - MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=MTA_Example
```

Once the docker container is up and running login using `sa` as the username and `MTA_Example` as the password. Create a database called `MTAMulti`

# Migration commands

Execute this from the top level solution directory that contains the `.sln` file to add migrations to `AppDbContext`.

##### Add migrations


```bash
dotnet ef migrations add Init --context AppDbContext --project MTA.Data --startup-project MTA.API --output-dir Migrations
```

>**NOTE:** The initial migration is already there that will create the necessary tables with their configuration and seed tenant information for testing.

##### Remove migrations

```bash
dotnet ef migrations remove --context AppDbContext --project MTA.Data --startup-project MTA.API
```

##### Database Update

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project MTA.Data --startup-project MTA.API
```

# Testing

The project runs on the following urls:

- https://localhost:7279
- http://localhost:5245

a controller was added to create tenants because each tenant gets its own connection string with a database allocated to it.

>**Note:** This is different from the original article. The original article you could isolate the tenant or not. When Isolated it will create a db for it. If not the tenant uses the default connection string meaning the default `MTAMulti` database.

### Available endpoints

#### Tenant endpoints

| Endpoint      | Method | Description            |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| /tenant       | POST   | Create new tenant      |

**Example Body**

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string"
}
```

- `id`: String value like `alpha`
- `name`: Full name like `Alpha Corporation`


#### Product endpoints

Remember to set the `tenant` header when calling the available endpoints. Swagger is already configured to require the header but you will need to set it manually when using something else like curl or postman.

>**Note:** The header resolver was only configured to work on the product endpoints. See `Program.cs`. Comment was left at configuration section.

| Endpoint      | Method | Description            |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| /product      | POST   | Create new product     |
| /product      | GET    | Get all products       |
| /product/{id} | DELETE | Delete product with ID |
| /product/{id} | GET    | Get product with ID    |
